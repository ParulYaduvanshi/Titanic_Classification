# Titanic-Classification
The Titanic classification ML project is a popular beginner-friendly machine learning task that involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various factors such as their age, gender, class, and cabin location. This project is often used to introduce students and newcomers to machine learning concepts and techniques.

Data Preparation

The first step in this project is to prepare the data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones. This can be useful for extracting additional information from the data that may be relevant to the prediction task. Some common feature engineering techniques include creating categorical variables, imputing missing values, and encoding categorical features.

Model Training

Once the data is prepared, it can be used to train a machine learning model. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for this task, but some common ones include logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests.

Model Evaluation

After training the model, it is important to evaluate its performance on a separate set of data. This is called the validation set. The evaluation metric used will depend on the specific task, but accuracy is a common measure of performance for classification problems.
